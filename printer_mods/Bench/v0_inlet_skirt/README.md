This inlet skirt is designed to specifically house the snap-in filtered & fused c14 inlet listed below. The inlet snaps in flush to maintain a low profile and match the aesthetics of the existing skirts.

## Required Parts:
* C14 Filtered Inlet (https://amzn.com/B009180QPQ)
* M3x8 BHCS (2x) for mounting
* M3 Nut (2x) for mounting

## Files: 
* `inlet_skirt.stl`: for mounting the inlet on the right side of the printer
* `inlet_skirt_mirrored.stl`: for mounting the inlet on the left side of the printer

## Notes: 
* Supports are included as part of the stl, remember to remove them prior to installing the inlet.
* Due to the large footprint of the filtered inlet, repositioning of the power supply, skr mini, and 5v converter might be necessary.
