# V0 Switched, Filtered, and Fused Inlet Skirt

![Image](./images/inlet_skirt.jpg) 

This inlet skirt is designed to specifically house the snap-in filtered & fused c14 inlet listed below. The inlet snaps in flush to maintain a low profile and match the aesthetics of the existing skirts. Due to the large footprint of the filtered inlet, repositioning of the power supply, skr mini, and 5v converter is necessary. I mounted my inlet on the right side of the printer, and had to swap the positions of the power supply and skr mini, and move the 5v converter to the back of the printer. 

## Required Parts:
* C14 Filtered Inlet (https://amzn.com/B009180QPQ)
* M3x8 BHCS (2x) for mounting
* M3 Nut (2x) for mounting

## Files: 
* `inlet_skirt.stl`: for mounting the inlet on the right side of the printer
* `inlet_skirt_mirrored.stl`: for mounting the inlet on the left side of the printer

## Notes: 
* Supports are included as part of the stl, remember to remove them prior to installing the inlet.
