# V0 Cable Chain Mount

![Image](./images/cable_chain_mount.png) 

This mounts the BOM cable chain to the frame and functions to straighten the chain from both ends so that the cable chain is constrained vertically upright and doesn't rub against the side window panel or the vertical z extrusion.
Also makes it a bit easier to detach the cable chain from the bottom frame.

## Required Parts:
* BOM Cable Chain (https://amzn.com/B01M1JDKZ0)
