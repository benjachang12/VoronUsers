This mount is designed specifically to mount the arducam webcam linked below. This camera was chosen for its wide FOV, night vision, and usb connection (don't have to deal with ribbon cables!). 
The two-piece design mounts the camera in the upper corner of the right side of the machine, which provides a decent view of the print bed while still being inside of the enclosure
